# Log Analyzer
Log Analyzer is a shell script designed to simplify the process of analyzing and understanding log files. By extracting key data points from your log files, such as timestamps of specific events and their frequency, it provides insights into your system's operations and potential issues.

## Features
- Analyze any text-based log files, identifying and counting specific event types.
- Timestamps for each specific event are printed for easy reference.
- Adaptable to different log formats.

## Usage
To run the log analyzer, navigate to the directory containing the script and the log file you want to analyze:

```
cd /path/to/directory
```
Then execute the script with the log file as an argument:

```
./log-analyzer.sh your-log-file.log
```
The script will print out the number of specific events it found in the log file, as well as their timestamps.

## Requirements

- Unix-like operating system (e.g., Linux, macOS)
- Bash shell

## Customization
To adapt the script to different log formats or to search for different events, modify the regular expression in the grep command inside the script.
